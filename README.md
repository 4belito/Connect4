## Connect 4 Game
This repository contains code for the Connect 4 game. It provides the interface for each player to program game logic, and then for players to be pitted against each other. 

## Rules

1. The board is a 6-row, 7-column grid erected vertically.
2. Each column is a shaft, such that a piece dropped in a column will fall to the bottom (or on top of the previous piece.)
3. Players take turns choosing which column to drop their piece in.
4. The objective of the game is to drop pieces such that and 4 of your pieces are connected horizintally, vertically, or diagonally first.
5. If there are no more empty spots left, and no player has connected 4 of their pieces, the game is a draw.
